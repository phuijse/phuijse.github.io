        <h2>Short bio</h2>
        
        <div class="col_l">
            Pablo was born in <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valdivia">Valdivia</a>, Chile</i> in 1985. He received his B.Sc. and P.E. degrees in Electrical Engineering from the <i>Universidad de Chile</i> in 2009. He received his PhD degree in Electrical Engineering from the <i>Universidad de Chile</i> in 2014. His research interest is on astronomical time series and image analysis using information theory, machine learning and computational intelligence concepts. In 2012 he visited the <a href="https://iacs.seas.harvard.edu/">Institute for Applied Computational Science</a> at Harvard University. In 2013 he visited the <a href="www.cnel.ufl.edu">Computational Neuroengineering Laboratory</a> at the University of Florida. In 2015-2017 he did a postdoc at the <a href="www.astrofisicamas.cl/en">Millennium Institute of Astrophysics</a>. In 2018 he obtained a position as assistant professor at the <a href="http://www.inf.uach.cl/">Informatics Institute</a>, <i>Universidad Austral de Chile</i>.

            Pablo is also a founder of Qualia where he works along his brother Cristian on the development of interactive objects that combine music and electronics; and also videogame software to convey immersive visual and musical experiences. His work in Qualia involves interactive design, game engines and video game design, generative art, music synthesis, physical interfaces and embedded system.

            Other scientific topics that interest Pablo very much (but for which he does not have much time) are dynamical systems and fractals. He is not very good at sports but he can run pretty fast and he swims like a fish. He thinks he knows how to cook and he is learning to play the transverse flute. He enjoys having long talks and playing PC videogames with his brother. He loves his wife very much.
