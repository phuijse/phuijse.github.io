<b>Pablo Huijse Heise</b>

This is my personal webpage, it contains a short bio, CV, educational material and a couple of interesting links. Cheers!

Excerpt 

Pablo was born in Valdivia, Chile in 1985. He received his B.S. and P.E. degrees in Electrical Engineering from the University of Chile in 2009. He received his PhD degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Chile in 2014. His research interest is on astronomical time series analysis using information theoretic, machine learning and computational intelligence concepts. Particularly, he has been working on periodic variable star detection, i.e. finding stars whose light changes in time following regular patterns. In 2012 he visited the Institute of Applied Computational Sciences at Harvard University where he built a fast pipeline for periodicity discrimination that was tested on the EROS-2 set. In 2013 he visited the Computational Neuroengineering Laboratory at the University of Florida, where he worked with Jose Principe in the development of a novel spectral estimation method. He knows how to code his own methods and has experience with HPC and GPGPU. He is currently a PostDoc at the Millennium Institute of Astrophysics, where he works on variability detection from images, periodicity and quasiperiodicity detection in light curves, feature extraction from light curves and periodic variable star classification. 

 


Pablo is also a founder of Qualia where he works along his brother Cristian on the development of interactive objects that combine music and electronics; and also videogame software to convey immersive visual and musical experiences. His work in Qualia involves interactive design, game engines and video game design, generative art, music synthesis, physical interfaces and embedded system.

Other scientific topics that interest Pablo very much (but for which he does not have much time) are artificial intelligence, dynamical systems and fractals. He is not very good at sports but he can run pretty fast and he swims like a fish. He thinks he knows how to cook and he is learning to play the transverse flute. Sometimes he misses the green of the south of Chile. He enjoys having long talks and playing PC videogames with his brother. He loves his girlfriend very much.
